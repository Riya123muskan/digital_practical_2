            <h3>Key Milestones in the History of Computers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ancient Calculating Devices (3000 BC – 17th Century)</strong>
                    <p>The first attempts at calculation were made with the use of simple devices like the abacus, which dates back to ancient Mesopotamia. Over time, more complex mechanical devices like the astrolabe and the slide rule emerged.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine (1837)</strong>
                    <p>Charles Babbage, known as the "father of the computer," designed the first mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. Though it was never completed during his lifetime, it laid the foundation for future computers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Turing Machine (1936)</strong>
                    <p>Alan Turing developed the concept of the Turing Machine, a theoretical construct that became the foundation for modern computing theory and algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The First Electronic Computers (1940s)</strong>
                    <p>During the 1940s, the first electronic computers were created, including the Colossus, used for code-breaking during World War II, and the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Personal Computer Revolution (1970s – 1980s)</strong>
                    <p>The development of personal computers, such as the Apple II, IBM PC, and the Macintosh, transformed computing into a household activity, bringing it into the mainstream and changing the way people work and communicate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Internet Age (1990s – Present)</strong>
                    <p>The invention and commercialization of the internet in the 1990s marked the beginning of the Information Age, radically transforming how people connect, communicate, and access information.</p>
